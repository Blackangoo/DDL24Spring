## Objectives

Your project accounts for 58% of your final grade. An experimental testbed you can optionally use (FLTK-testbed) is available on Github Classroom (see below)

Here, you need to first reproduce one of the one of the four papers below using a framework of your choice. 

Secondly, you need to come up with solutions to further improve the performance metrics of your choice.&nbsp; Your final grade depends on (i) the rigorousness&nbsp; and correctness of your reproduction experiments, (ii) the percentage of performance improvement of your solution compared to the original paper, (iii) the readability of your report.&nbsp;

We provide you Pytorch-based of distributed/decentralized framework:You can find the implementation and user manual below.&nbsp; We also provide you the google cloud coupon so that you can reproduce the results on the Google cloud.&nbsp;

## Key milestones

Milestones (All the documents need to be submitted via the ILISAS. Exact due dates are on the ILIAS.)&nbsp;



1. **Project proposal** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 5
2. **Intermediate project meeting** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback): due on week 9
3. **Final project report** (mandatory, graded): due on week 14
4. **20 min project presentation**
(mandatory, graded): due on week 14


## Grading breakdown
- Final report: 65%
- 15 min project presentation: 15 %
- Individual contribution: 20%

## Paper list


## Report formats

### Project proposal

The proposal should contain between 300 and 400 words. Your proposal should address the following points:

1. Which paper to reporduce
2. What configuration
3. Which figures and tables

**Submission**: every group uploads their proposal on ILIAS. The proposal should be in PDF format and should contain the group name and the list of group members (name, student IDs).

**Feedback**: the course team will provide feedback on the project proposal within a few days.

### Final project report

The **final** group project report should be **20-25 slides** 
 <!---The **intermediate** project report is likely to be shorter (it is due a week before the final deadline), that is fine, submit whatever you have by then.)
 -->

We suggest the following final report structure:

- Motivation
- Background of the paper
- Method proposed by the paper
- Reproducing results (with a lot of figures and tables)
- Your proposed improvement, describing the weakness of current paper and  your optimization algorithms
- Conclusions: what can be the future direction
- References

The final report should also contain a link to a repository (or several) that contain the software you created, the scripts you used to analyze your data, etc.

Submission: every group uploads their intermediate presentation and final group project reports on Brightspace. The reports should be in PDF format. Note that after submission a plagiarism check is executed by Turnitin - please make sure to follow the academic rules of writing ([you can read them up here one more time](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/copyright/c/plagiarism/)).

In addition, your report must also include a figure that graphically depicts a major component of your project (e.g., your approach and how it relates to the application, etc.). Such a summary figure makes your paper much more accessible by providing a visual counterpart to the text. Developing such a concise and clear figure can actually be quite time-consuming; I often go through around ten versions before I end up with a good final version.

The final project report is graded in combination with the project interview. The interview will be an academic discussion about the executed project.

## Interviews

The 15 minute interviews per group will be scheduled on the last lecture.
